Hi, this is Yosef.

1. The index page uses the CSS and JavaScript file that isn't in the folder.
2. The other pages are mainly served by the CSS and JavaScript files that are inside the folder.

3. The photos for the index page are mostly located in the "images" file.

4.The photos for the index page are mostly located in the "img/app" file.

5. In order to avoid latency, you must store the picture in JavaScript and update the photographs in the CSS (@keyframes slide animation) before making any changes to the slide images. Because JavaScript loads the image.

6. To receive customer orders, you need to establish a proper link or integration with a backend system for "Send Message" button located in the index.html page.
